## Container Tools for Mavericks 20260719-mavericks.1

A packaged, self-updating **Docker toolchain for OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)** — a signed `.pkg`, meant as a
drop-in successor to the hand-built "Container Tools for Mavericks" DMG, with newer components and an updater.

Versioned by date because this is a *distribution* of independently-versioned components rather than a
single upstream.

## Components in this build

- **docker** CLI — docker/cli v29.6.2
- **docker compose** — v5.3.1 (CLI plugin + standalone `docker-compose`)
- **docker-machine** — v0.16.2
- **lazydocker** — v0.25.2, a terminal UI for Docker
- **boot2docker.iso** — dragonflylee v23.0.6
- **docked** — one-off-container convenience wrapper (after Wowfunhappy's DMG)
- A background **Sparkle auto-updater** (daily check)

All binaries are cross-built for x86_64 / min-10.9 with the patched mavericks Go toolchain and are
**self-contained** — legacy-support is linked in statically, so there is no dylib to install.

## Requires

OS X 10.9.5 or later, plus **VMware Fusion** to run the Docker daemon. After installing, see
`/usr/local/share/modernmavericks/container-tools/README.txt` for the one-line `docker-machine create` setup.

## Note

This is a **prerelease** for real-10.9 validation; it is not served to the auto-updater until promoted
to a full release.
